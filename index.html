    <p id="purple">See some of the albums that we've discussed so far, such as Flamingosis's "Mood Provider 10" (technically a mixtape), and Lauryn Hill's classic "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill!"</p> 
    
  <div class="flex-container">
      <div>    <img src="Flamingosis Mood Provider 10.jpg" alt="Flamingo in a boot in space, the album cover" width="250" height="250">
      <p> "Mood Provider 10", by Flamingosis. The last in his mood provider series. The beat switch on "Intrepid Method" nearly brings me to tears, possibly the best single track in the whole series!</p></div>
      <div>    <img src="Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.jpg" alt="Lauryn Hill's face on a desk, the album cover" width="250" height="250">
        <p>
          Lauryn Hill's classic "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill!" It's gotta go to "Doo Wap (That Thing)", for me, but is there really a bad track on here?
        </p>

      <div>    <img src="Arcade.jpg" alt = "An arcade machine in a sort of runny ink, like it's jumping into cysberspace or getting dragged past a blackhole's event horizon" width="250" height="250">
      <p> 
        Arcade, a short lp by Tomppabeats with only two songs over two minutes, a beat tape really. Short and sweet with something to enjoy for all. "Just One More Dance" makes me wanna boogie >_>. 
      </p>

      <div>    <img src="Aeroplane.jpg" alt="A child and presumably a mother, saluting like a certain german. The mother's head is a drum. There is a sea in the background with a couple children and a boat in it. The album cover" width="250" height="250">
      <p> 
        Neutral Milk Hotel's classic "In The Aeroplane Over The Sea." Some instrumental tracks, so high energy, low energy too. "Two-Headed Boy" has to be my favorite. 
      </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Bartek's Album for King Crimson -->
      <div>    <img src="KingCrimson.jpeg" alt="A Horrified Looking Face (Schizoid Man)" width="250" height="250">
        <p>
        Classic debut album by King Crimson! Pioneered the music genres of Progressive Rock, Heavy Metal, and Psychedelic Rock!
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- Bartek's Album for None of This is Real -->
      <div>    <img src="NONEOFTHISISREAL.jpg" alt="A very mystical looking wizard who beseeches you to embark upon an epic quest!" width="250" height="250">
        <p>
        An Experimental album which is plunderphonic in nature, and was made exclusively in Audacity!

          And if you find a banger album that's got you grooving like this dog, you could get on this wall too!! :0 This space is calling your name
